I am an applied scientist at [Microsoft, Project Turing](https://msturing.org), working on large-scale pretraining of language representation and generation models. Before joining Microsoft, I am a research associate in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Professor [Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/). My previous research revolves around deep learning, multimodal machine learning and natural language processing. I obtained my M.Sc in Intelligent Information Systems degree from CMU and B.Sc in Applied Mathematics degree from Wuhan University.
